visual_news_interface
=====================

Final Project for the Visual Interfaces for Computer class @ Columbia University

We implemented a visual interface that solves a journalistic problem - assisting audiences with disabilities to better access news articles. These people might have difficulty searching, filtering, and reading news on the web; audible news would be greatly helpful to them. Users can apply gestures to manipulate the system and search for breaking national news and breaking international news via the Google News Search engine.

List of files according to dependence:

visual_news_interface.py
constants.py
skin.py
imgproc.py
gesture.py
news.py


The visual_news_interface.py is our main function of this project. It imports constants.py, skin.py, imgproc.py and gesture.py applications to initialize and analyze hand gestures. The main program also imports the news.py application to search and filter news articles from the mainstream media press
